# üß† Binary Imbalanced Classification: Pedestrian Gender Classification

This project addresses the challenge of **binary classification on an imbalanced dataset**, specifically for classifying the **gender of pedestrians** based on visual features. Various techniques are used including data augmentation, low- and high-level feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multiple classification models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn opencv-python matplotlib
Preprocess the images

## üìä Model Evaluation

Performance is measured using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

Imbalanced classification techniques such as **data augmentation** and **class weighting** were applied.
