# 🧠 Binary Imbalanced Classification: Pedestrian Gender Classification

This project addresses the challenge of **binary classification on an imbalanced dataset**, specifically for classifying the **gender of pedestrians** based on visual features. Various techniques are used including data augmentation, low- and high-level feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multiple classification models.
